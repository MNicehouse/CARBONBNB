# CarbonBNB
During our projects week in LeWagon Coding bootcamp we set up an AirBnB clone to host and book flats.

# How it works
CarbonBNB is an online marketplace that allows people to list, find, and book accommodations in more than 220 countries and regions around the world. It works by connecting travelers with hosts who have extra space to rent out, such as apartments, houses, or even a single room in their home.

# Tech Stack
We developed our Webapp with the Ruby on Rails Framework deployed it with Heroku.
